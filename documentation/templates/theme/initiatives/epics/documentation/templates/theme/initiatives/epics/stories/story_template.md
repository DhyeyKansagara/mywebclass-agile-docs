## User Registration

**As a** user, **I want to** be able to create an account so that I can access the application.

**Description:**
I want to be able to register for an account by providing my email address and a secure password. After providing the required information, I should receive a confirmation email to verify my account.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The user should be able to navigate to the registration page from the application's homepage.
- The registration page should have fields for the user's email address and password.
- The password field should have validation to ensure it meets the application's security requirements.
- The user should receive a confirmation email after submitting their registration information.
- The confirmation email should contain a link that the user can click to verify their account.
- Once the user verifies their account, they should be able to log in to the application.

**Notes:**
- If the user enters an email address that is already associated with an existing account, they should receive an error message and be prompted to either reset their password or use a different email address.
- The password field should have a strength indicator to guide the user towards creating a secure password.
