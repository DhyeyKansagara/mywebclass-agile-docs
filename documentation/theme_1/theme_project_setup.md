# Theme 1.0: Project Setup

## Overview
Our objective is to establish a highly visible web presence using lean and agile principles to quickly and effectively develop a strong foundation for our web project. By completing the initiatives outlined in this theme, we can establish a solid foundation that ensures our web page meets our business requirements throughout the life of the project, setting us up for long-term success.

## Initiatives
We will undertake the following initiatives to achieve our objective:

1. * [Project scope](initiatives/project_scope.md) Develop initial project documentation to establish a clear project scope. This documentation will include details on the project goals, requirements, timelines, stakeholders, and budget. By having a clear project scope documented, we can ensure that everyone involved in the project understands what is expected and can work together more efficiently.

2. * [CI-CD](initiatives/initiative_devops.md)Set up the CI/CD DevOps processes to ensure efficient and collaborative development practices. This will involve implementing continuous integration and delivery processes that allow developers to work collaboratively and deploy changes to the web page quickly and efficiently. By automating the build, testing, and deployment processes, we can reduce the time and effort required to release changes to the web page, while maintaining a high level of quality and consistency.

3. * [Initial Web Page](initiatives/initiative_basic_webpage_template.md) Create an initial web page template that includes monitoring tools to continuously improve the quality of our project, such as:
    - Website analytics to collect data that can be used to continuously improve our web page for our community members.
    - Project metrics to continuously improve the management of the project.

By undertaking these initiatives, we can establish a solid foundation for our web project and ensure that it meets our business requirements throughout the life of the project.


## Test Plan
To ensure the success of our initiatives, we will test the following:

1. The accuracy and completeness of the project documentation.
2. The efficiency and collaboration of the CI/CD DevOps processes.
3. The business requirements and visual appeal of the web page template.
4. The effectiveness of the monitoring tools in improving the quality of our project.

By completing these initiatives and testing our plan, we can establish a strong foundation for our web project that meets our business requirements and sets us up for long-term success.
